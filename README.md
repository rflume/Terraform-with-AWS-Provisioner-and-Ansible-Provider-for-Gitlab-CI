# Terraform with AWS Provider and Ansible Provisioner for Gitlab CI

**Important note: This image is yet untested because changing from Terraform 0.11 to 0.12 requires some code adaptations. Please create an issue if you encounter any bugs with this image!**

**The tag `latest` will for the first remain using Terraform v0.11! However, to ensure always using the correct version please use the specific version tag!**

This Docker images is based on the official **`hashicorp/terraform:0.12.7`** Terraform image and extends it with the [Terraform AWS Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/releases) and [Ansible Provisioner by radekg](https://github.com/radekg/terraform-provisioner-ansible).

**It is intended for the use as base image for [GitLab CI pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/quick_start/README.html).** You can read my full article on how to use the image at Medium.com: [About Infrastructure on AWS, Automated with Terraform, Ansible and GitLab CI](https://medium.com/@robinflume/about-infrastructure-on-aws-automated-with-terraform-ansible-and-gitlab-ci-5888fe2e85fc).

The image is build as [Docker Multi-Stage Build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). This feature requires Docker Engine `v17.05` or higher.*

## Docker Tags

The image is build with with the following tags:

* `latest`: Built from `master` branch. Contains the software versions stated below in the [Default Versions](#default-versions) section.
* `tf-x.yy.zz`: Built from any branch starting with `tf-[x].[yy].[zz][...]`. The Terraform version seems to me to be the most relevant software version, so any other version is ommitted.

If you need to pull images by the AWS Provider and Ansible Provisioner versions as well, please open an issue.

## Default Versions

The image needs to be build with Docker `build-args` which default to the following versions:

* Terraform: **`0.12.9`**
* AWS Provisioner: `2.39.0`
* Ansible Provisioner: `2.3.3`

You can overwrite the versions of both the AWS Provisioner and the Ansible Provider within the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build -t terraform-aws-ansible --build-arg AWS_PROVIDER_VERSION=2.5.0 --build-arg ANSIBLE_PROVISIONER_VERSION=2.1.1 .
```

Available versions can be found here:

* [AWS Provider Versions](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/releases)
* [Ansible Provisioner Versions](https://github.com/radekg/terraform-provisioner-ansible/releases)

## Usage

The sections below will provide some example configuration how to use this Docker imnage.

### Required Secrets

The image can be used to automate your infrastructure creation with Gitlab CI pipelines. It is therefor required to provide both AWS credentials and login data of the user that the Ansible provisioner uses.

These must be provided as Gitlab CI secrets (project environment variables):

* `ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS`: The password to become root on the hosts to be provisioned by ansible
* `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASS`: The password the decrypt the [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) (optional)
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: An AWS access key id to be used by the AWS provider
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: An AWS secret key to be used by the AWS provider
* `ID_RSA_TERRAFORM`: An SSH private key to be used by Ansible

### Project Layout

The GitLab CI example pipeline configuration in section [Gitlab CI Pipeline Configuration](#gitlab-ci-pipeline-configuration) works for the following project layout:

```text
├── ansible-provisioning
│ └── roles
│   └── my-global-role
│     └── ...
│
├── global
│   ├── files
│   │ └── user_data.sh

```

### Ansible Provisioning

To provision a newly created resource *directly* within Terraform, the Ansible provisioner is included in the image. For more information on available parameters, checkout the [GitHub project by radekg](https://github.com/radekg/terraform-provisioner-ansible).

This is a brief example on how to use Ansible provisioning with this Docker image:

```t
# ec2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "default" {
   ...
   user_data = "${data.terraform_remote_state.global.user_data}"
   ...
   associate_public_ip_address = true
   key_name = "${data.terraform_remote_state.global.ssh_pubkey}"
   # ignore user_data updates, as this will require a new resource!
   lifecycle {
     ignore_changes = [
       "user_data",
     ]
   }
}

# instance provisioner
resource "null_resource" "default_provisioner" {
  triggers {
    default_instance_id = "${aws_instance.default.id}"
  }

  connection {
    host = "${aws_instance.default.public_ip}"
    type = "ssh"
    user = "terraform"   # as created in 'user_data'
    private_key = "${file("/root/.ssh/id_rsa_terraform")}"
  }
  # wait for the instance to become available
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "echo 'ready'"
    ]
  }
  # ansible provisioner
  provisioner "ansible" {
    plays {
      playbook = {
        file_path = "${path.module}/ansible/playbook/main.yml"
        roles_path = [
          "${path.module}/../../../../../ansible-provisioning/roles",
        ]
      }
    hosts = ["${aws_instance.default.public_ip}"]
    become = true
    become_method = "sudo"
    become_user = "root"

    extra_vars = {
      ...
      ansible_become_pass = "${file("/etc/ansible/become_pass")}"
    }

    vault_password_file = "/etc/ansible/vault_password_file"
  }
}
```

### Gitlab CI Pipeline Configuration

The actual pipeline can be configured as shown in this example:

```yml
image:
  name: rflume/terraform-aws-ansible:latest

stages:
  # Dev environment stages
  - validate dev
  - plan dev
  - apply dev

variables:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# Create files w/ required the secrets
before_script:
  - echo "$ID_RSA_TERRAFORM" > /root/.ssh/id_rsa_terraform
  - echo "$ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASS" > /etc/ansible/vault_password_file
  - echo "$ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS" > /etc/ansible/become_pass

# Apply Terraform on DEV environment
validate:dev:
  stage: validate dev
  script:
    - cd environments/dev
    - terraform init
    - terraform validate
  only:
    changes:
      - environments/dev/**/*
      - modules/**/*

plan:dev:
  stage: plan dev
  script:
    - cd environments/dev
    - terraform init
    - terraform plan -out "planfile_dev"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - environments/dev/planfile_dev
  only:
    changes:
      - environments/dev/**/*
      - modules/**/*

apply:dev:
  stage: apply dev
  script:
    - cd environments/dev
    - terraform init
    - terraform apply -input=false "planfile_dev"
  dependencies:
    - plan:dev
  allow_failure: false
  only:
    refs:
      - master
    changes:
      - environments/dev/**/*
      - modules/**/*
```
